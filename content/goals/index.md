The goal is to create a <b>research networking tool</b> that allows researchers and decision-makers to access centralized research information.

## A Web Application

Our first goal was to create a responsive web app to display relevant data we have collected. For this specific project, fancy charts and visualizations were not necessary as we simply displayed data tables; in future development, we intend to add more robust data visualization techniques to help users grasp key ideas, concepts, and trends in research.  

The web-app was developed with Next.js for the front-end and Node.js supporting the backend with server-side rendering, ensuring high performance even as we scale. The Vite framework was utlized to complement reactjs in development.
