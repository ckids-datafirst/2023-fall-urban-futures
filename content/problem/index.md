## Project Motivation

In the dynamic landscape of urban planning, we face a significant challengeâ€”the absence of a centralized data hub for research. The multifaceted nature of urban environments, with their economic, social, and environmental intricacies, demands a comprehensive approach. However, the current disarray in urban research impedes our ability to efficiently tackle these complexities. The scattered nature of data sources, combined with a lack of a cohesive framework, limits our capacity for informed decision-making in urban planning.

Without a unified platform, we grapple with inefficient problem-solving. Disorganized urban research not only hinders the extraction of valuable insights but also obstructs the collaboration necessary for effective solutions. Urban challenges require a collective effort, yet collaboration remains uncommon due to the disparate nature of research endeavors. This fragmentation prevents us from fully understanding and addressing the nuanced needs of urban environments, hindering our potential to develop sustainable and impactful solutions.

As we delve into "The Problem," our mission is clear: establish a centralized knowledge hub that transcends these challenges, enabling us to make more informed decisions, foster collaboration, and unlock the full potential of urban planning.
