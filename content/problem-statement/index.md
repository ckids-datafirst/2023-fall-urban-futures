## Introduction

This page serves as a **Problem and Requirements Document** for the project.  It should be no more than 5 pages long.  It should be done after or in combination with the Data Assessment document.  It should have an initial release after no more than four weeks into the project, and can serve as an interim project report.  It can be refined as the project progresses and the project is better understood.  

## Motivation

The project advisor should have provided the general context for the project, the kinds of problems that could be addressed using the data available, and the overall motivation for working in this area.  

## Problem for the Semester

While the motivation section typically describes the long-term reasons to tackle this project, the problem section should focus on the specific problem and goals selected for the current semester.  It should be a realistic goal that can be accomplished with the resources available, and this typically means the data, the people, the time available.  It is useful to be specific about the initial questions that will be addressed first, because those typically lead to a better understanding of what other questions could be tackled.  This will help establish a clear scope for the project that will give everyone reasonable confidence of what the team can achieve.  It is also very useful to describe what the team is not going to tackle and has agreed to leave for future work.

## State of the Art

Provide a brief summary or survey of the possible approaches, advances, or tools that are currently available that could potentially be used to address the problem.  

## Design and Approach

Discuss the initial approach that the team will follow.  This may include the key idea that the team believes could potentially work, and a high-level description of 1) the system to be built and a diagram of its components, 2) the inputs to the system and the task that it will do with that data, and 3) the outputs to be generated. Discuss also a baseline system that is simple and can be quickly built to address the problem in a reasonable way even if it has poor performance, so that you can clearly show improvements.  Discuss also how those improvements will be demonstrated through metrics or other means.

## Use Case Scenario

Show with a use case scenario with examples of who the ultimate users could be, what the system that you plan to build for the semester will do in that scenario.  Provide a mockup of the outputs for the use case that you propose.

## Desired Outcomes and Benefits

Connect back the system that you will be building with the initial motivation for the work, and what additional future work might be needed in order for the system to provide benefits to its users.
