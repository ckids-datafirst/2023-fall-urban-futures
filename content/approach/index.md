This page contains key sections of the **Final Report** for the project focused on the data science methodology used to approach the problem.  It should be no more than 3 pages long.  It should be done after or in combination with the Requirements document.  It should have an initial release after no more than eight weeks into the project, and can serve as an interim project report.  It can be refined as the project progresses and the problem is better understood.  

## Data Quality

Describe any steps that were used to address any issues concerning the quality of the data.  This may include collecting data quality metrics, discarding subsets of the data, or applying specific techniques for handling missing values, dealing with outliers, etc. 

## Data Preprocessing

Describe the steps taken to preprocess the raw data to prepare it for analysis. This may include data transformations to convert to a required format, feature engineering operations, encoding features as binary, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Discuss any techniques employed to gain insights into the data. This could include data visualizations, generating summary statistics, initial analysis, and other exploratory techniques used to understand the data distributions, features, and helpful patterns.

## Model Development

Describe the algorithms, methodology, and architectures used to generate models.  Discuss how models were generated, seeded, and improved.  Show the libraries and frameworks used for model development, as well as the rationale behind those choices.

## Model Evaluation

Discuss the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance, and justify those choices based on the problem that the project is addressing. Describe the evaluation techniques used, such as cross-validation, and how undesirable model behaviors, such as overfitting, were avoided.
