It should have an initial release after no more than eight weeks into the project, and can serve as an interim project report. It can be refined as the project progresses and the problem is better understood.\nData Quality Describe any steps that were used to address any issues concerning the quality of the data. This may include collecting data quality metrics, discarding subsets of the data, or applying specific techniques for handling missing values, dealing with outliers, etc.\nData Preprocessing Describe the steps taken to preprocess the raw data to prepare it for analysis. This may include data transformations to convert to a required format, feature engineering operations, encoding features as binary, etc.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Discuss any techniques employed to gain insights into the data. This could include data visualizations, generating summary statistics, initial analysis, and other exploratory techniques used to understand the data distributions, features, and helpful patterns.\nModel Development Describe the algorithms, methodology, and architectures used to generate models. Discuss how models were generated, seeded, and improved. Show the libraries and frameworks used for model development, as well as the rationale behind those choices.\nModel Evaluation Discuss the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance, and justify those choices based on the problem that the project is addressing. Describe the evaluation techniques used, such as cross-validation, and how undesirable model behaviors, such as overfitting, were avoided.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701415560,"objectID":"34e1e0791ee61c3e17f35ea7a38c832a","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-urban-futures/goals/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-urban-futures/goals/","section":"","summary":"Data science methodology used to address the problem, including data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering techniques, machine learning models, and evaluation metrics.","tags":null,"title":"Approach","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Faculty Data Data for USC Price faculty will be gathered from the Price faculty page\nWe can obtain name, contact, position, expertise, degrees, and a biological sketch of each professor.\nGoogle Scholar Pages Most faculty have a Google Scholar Page, where we can pull data relating to each faculty’s research publications. Each publication has a title, authors, year, and number of citations, as well as a vast pool of textual data.\nExtraction Methods Using Python with Google Colab notebooks, we generated a web-scraping script that obtained the necessary information. Package BeautifulSoup provided a framework for obtaining data from each webpage.\n“Information for faculty and their publications were stored in dictionaries as key:value pairs and connected by faculty name as the primary key.”\nExtracting data from the text of publications proved to be a difficult task, one we did not complete during the scope of this semester.\nUsing spaCy, we were able to generate named entity recognitions and successfully fetch the dataset names using custom rules of finding organizations (example: JULIET clinical trial).\nHowever, the variation among the format of publications yielded poor model training results.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701416677,"objectID":"be566fdb6f0fa08cfea50d77a89a6b5a","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-urban-futures/data/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-urban-futures/data/","section":"","summary":"Summary","tags":null,"title":"Data and Methods","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project Motivation In the dynamic landscape of urban planning, we face a significant challenge—the absence of a centralized data hub for research. The multifaceted nature of urban environments, with their economic, social, and environmental intricacies, demands a comprehensive approach. However, the current disarray in urban research impedes our ability to efficiently tackle these complexities. The scattered nature of data sources, combined with a lack of a cohesive framework, limits our capacity for informed decision-making in urban planning.\nWithout a unified platform, we grapple with inefficient problem-solving. Disorganized urban research not only hinders the extraction of valuable insights but also obstructs the collaboration necessary for effective solutions. Urban challenges require a collective effort, yet collaboration remains uncommon due to the disparate nature of research endeavors. This fragmentation prevents us from fully understanding and addressing the nuanced needs of urban environments, hindering our potential to develop sustainable and impactful solutions.\nAs we delve into “The Problem,” our mission is clear: establish a centralized knowledge hub that transcends these challenges, enabling us to make more informed decisions, foster collaboration, and unlock the full potential of urban planning.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701415818,"objectID":"e30fe748673226642290a59974143ef2","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-urban-futures/problem/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-urban-futures/problem/","section":"","summary":"Uninformed Decision-Making in Urban Landscapes: A Barrier to Sustainable Progess and Untapped Opportunities.","tags":null,"title":"Problem","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This page contains key sections of the Final Report for the project focused on results to date.
