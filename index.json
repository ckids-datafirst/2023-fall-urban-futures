This may include collecting data quality metrics, discarding subsets of the data, or applying specific techniques for handling missing values, dealing with outliers, etc.\nData Preprocessing Describe the steps taken to preprocess the raw data to prepare it for analysis. This may include data transformations to convert to a required format, feature engineering operations, encoding features as binary, etc.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Discuss any techniques employed to gain insights into the data. This could include data visualizations, generating summary statistics, initial analysis, and other exploratory techniques used to understand the data distributions, features, and helpful patterns.\nModel Development Describe the algorithms, methodology, and architectures used to generate models. Discuss how models were generated, seeded, and improved. Show the libraries and frameworks used for model development, as well as the rationale behind those choices.\nModel Evaluation Discuss the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance, and justify those choices based on the problem that the project is addressing. Describe the evaluation techniques used, such as cross-validation, and how undesirable model behaviors, such as overfitting, were avoided.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696363132,"objectID":"3e050718825977bdecb55c075afa314a","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-urban-futures/approach/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-urban-futures/approach/","section":"","summary":"Data science methodology used to address the problem, including data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering techniques, machine learning models, and evaluation metrics.","tags":null,"title":"Approach","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction Data Overview and Examples Give a brief description of the data provided for this project, what it represents, how it was collected, and why it may help address the problem you are tackling. Discuss if you will be using all the data or only some subset of it for the project. Consider possible additional data that may be publicly available in the open Web that might complement the data that you are given.\nData Accessibility Summarize how the data can be accessed. For example, data may be available for download in files, or accessible through an API, or can be queried from a database. Mention any restrictions in accessing the data, for example if it is sensitive data that can only accessed with special permission.\nData Formats Describe briefly the formats of the data. Common data formats include CSV, JSON, XML, shapefiles, or any other specific formats relevant to your website.\nData Challenges Summarize why analyzing this data will be challenging. This may include issues like data heterogeneity, data size, and any pre- or post-processing needs. Explain some ideas for how these challenges could be addressed.\nData Visualizations and Highlights Including a visualization is a simple way to show something interesting about the data. Perhaps the visualizations could simply highlight the size, distribution, and other simple statistical characteristics of the data.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701414586,"objectID":"e30fe748673226642290a59974143ef2","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-urban-futures/problem/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-urban-futures/problem/","section":"","summary":"Data Assessment Document that gives an overview of the data used for the project.","tags":null,"title":"Data Assessment","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction This page serves as a Problem and Requirements Document for the project. It should be no more than 5 pages long. It should be done after or in combination with the Data Assessment document. It should have an initial release after no more than four weeks into the project, and can serve as an interim project report. It can be refined as the project progresses and the project is better understood.\nMotivation The project advisor should have provided the general context for the project, the kinds of problems that could be addressed using the data available, and the overall motivation for working in this area.\nProblem for the Semester While the motivation section typically describes the long-term reasons to tackle this project, the problem section should focus on the specific problem and goals selected for the current semester. It should be a realistic goal that can be accomplished with the resources available, and this typically means the data, the people, the time available. It is useful to be specific about the initial questions that will be addressed first, because those typically lead to a better understanding of what other questions could be tackled. This will help establish a clear scope for the project that will give everyone reasonable confidence of what the team can achieve. It is also very useful to describe what the team is not going to tackle and has agreed to leave for future work.\nState of the Art Provide a brief summary or survey of the possible approaches, advances, or tools that are currently available that could potentially be used to address the problem.\nDesign and Approach Discuss the initial approach that the team will follow. This may include the key idea that the team believes could potentially work, and a high-level description of 1) the system to be built and a diagram of its components, 2) the inputs to the system and the task that it will do with that data, and 3) the outputs to be generated. Discuss also a baseline system that is simple and can be quickly built to address the problem in a reasonable way even if it has poor performance, so that you can clearly show improvements. Discuss also how those improvements will be demonstrated through metrics or other means.\nUse Case Scenario Show with a use case scenario with examples of who the ultimate users could be, what the system that you plan to build for the semester will do in that scenario. Provide a mockup of the outputs for the use case that you propose.\nDesired Outcomes and Benefits Connect back the system that you will be building with the initial motivation for the work, and what additional future work might be needed in order for the system to provide benefits to its users.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696363132,"objectID":"b7c3446bb0d5d7e8a477294017361379","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-urban-futures/problem-statement/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-urban-futures/problem-statement/","section":"","summary":"Problem and Requirements document that will drive the work to be done in the project","tags":null,"title":"Problem and Requirements","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This page contains key sections of the Final Report for the project focused on results to date.
