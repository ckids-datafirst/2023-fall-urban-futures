Each publication has a title, authors, year, and number of citations, as well as a vast pool of textual data.\nExtraction Methods Using Python with Google Colab notebooks, we generated a web-scraping script that obtained the necessary information. The package BeautifulSoup provided a framework for obtaining data from each webpage.\nInformation for faculty and their publications were stored in dictionaries as key:value pairs and connected by faculty name as the primary key.\nExtracting data from the text of publications proved to be a difficult task, one we did not complete during the scope of this semester.\nUsing spaCy, we were able to generate named entity recognitions and successfully fetch the dataset names using custom rules of finding organizations (example: JULIET clinical trial). However, the variation among the format of publications yielded poor model training results.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701417337,"objectID":"be566fdb6f0fa08cfea50d77a89a6b5a","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-urban-futures/data/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-urban-futures/data/","section":"","summary":"Summary","tags":null,"title":"Data and Methods","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project Motivation In the dynamic landscape of urban planning, we face a significant challenge—the absence of a centralized data hub for research. The multifaceted nature of urban environments, with their economic, social, and environmental intricacies, demands a comprehensive approach. However, the current disarray in urban research impedes our ability to efficiently tackle these complexities. The scattered nature of data sources, combined with a lack of a cohesive framework, limits our capacity for informed decision-making in urban planning.\nWithout a unified platform, we grapple with inefficient problem-solving. Disorganized urban research not only hinders the extraction of valuable insights but also obstructs the collaboration necessary for effective solutions. Urban challenges require a collective effort, yet collaboration remains uncommon due to the disparate nature of research endeavors. This fragmentation prevents us from fully understanding and addressing the nuanced needs of urban environments, hindering our potential to develop sustainable and impactful solutions.\nAs we delve into “The Problem,” our mission is clear: establish a centralized knowledge hub that transcends these challenges, enabling us to make more informed decisions, foster collaboration, and unlock the full potential of urban planning.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701415818,"objectID":"e30fe748673226642290a59974143ef2","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/2023-fall-urban-futures/problem/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-urban-futures/problem/","section":"","summary":"Uninformed Decision-Making in Urban Landscapes: A Barrier to Sustainable Progess and Untapped Opportunities.","tags":null,"title":"Problem","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With the beta version of the web app deployed, we are excited to continue work on the Urban Futures Data Core.

For this specific project, fancy charts and visualizations were not necessary as we simply displayed data tables; in future development, we intend to add more robust data visualization techniques to help users grasp key ideas, concepts, and trends in research.\nThe web-app was developed with Next.js for the front-end and Node.js supporting the backend with server-side rendering, ensuring high performance even as we scale.
